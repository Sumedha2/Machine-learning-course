#Competitive question
#Question 1
# Your task is pretty simple , given a string S , find the total count of numbers present in the digit.
#

# the length of the string . The second line of each and every test case will contain a string S of length N.
#
# Output
#
# For each and every testcase , output the total count of numbers present in the string.
#
# Constraints
#
# 0 < T < 200
#
# 0 < N < 10000

# Question 4
# Little Jhool always wanted to have some psychic powers so that he could showoff his skills, and magic to people and 
# impress them. (Specially, his girlfriend Big Jhool!) But, in spite all his efforts, hardwork, dedication, Googling,
# watching youtube videos he couldn't garner any psychic abilities!
#
# He knew everyone was making fun of him, so to stop all of that - he came up with a smart plan. Anyone who came to him
# to know about their future, he asked them to write a binary number for him - and then, he smartly told them if the future
# for that person had good in store, or bad.
#
# The algorithm which Little Jhool follows is, as following:
#
# If the binary number written by the person has six consecutive 0s, or 1s, his future is bad.
# Otherwise, he says that their future is good.
#
# Input format:
# Single line contains a binary number.
# Output format:
#
# You need to print "Good luck!" (Without quotes, and WITH exclamation mark!) if the Jhool is going to tell them that
# they're going to have a good time. Else, print "Sorry, sorry!" if the person is going to be told that he'll have a hard
# time!
#
# Constraints:
#
# The binary number will be in string format, with the maximum length being 100 characters

# Question 5
# The great Kian is looking for a smart prime minister. He's looking for a guy who can solve the OLP (Old Legendary Problem).
# OLP is an old problem (obviously) that no one was able to solve it yet (like P=NP).
#
# But still, you want to be the prime minister really bad. So here's the problem:
#
# Given the sequence a1, a2, ..., an find the three values a1 + a4 + a7 + ..., a2 + a5 + a8 + ... and a3 + a6 + a9 + ... (
# these summations go on while the indexes are valid).
#
# Input
# The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
# The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an separated by space (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).
#
# Output
# Print three values in one line (the answers).
# SAMPLE INPUT
# 5
# 1 2 3 4 5
#
# SAMPLE OUTPUT
# 5 7 3

# Question 6
# In the race for the best Internet browser, there's now a new contender for it, this browser is called the: "The Semantic
# Mind-Reader!" After its promo on the world wide web, everyone's been desperately waiting for the browser to be released.
# And why shouldn't they be curious about it, after all, it's the new project of our very own genius "Little Jhool!" He's
# worked very hard for this browser, and to add new mind reading features to it.
#
# Apart from the various security powers it possesses, it's called the mind-reader for a reason. Here's why:
#
# You don't need to type 'www.' to open a website anymore.
# Though, you still need to type '.com' to open a website.
# The browser predicts ALL THE VOWELS in the name of the website. (Not '.com', though. Again!)
# Obviously, this means you can type the name of a website faster and save some time.
# Now to convince users that his browser will indeed save A LOT of time for users to open a particular website, Little
# Jhool has asked you to prepare a report on the same.
#
# Input format:
# The first line contains tc, the number of test cases.
# The second line contains the name of websites, as a string.
#
# Output format:
# You have to print the ratio of characters you would have typed in Jhool's browser, to your normal browser.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= tc <= 100
# 1 <= Length of the website <= 200
#
# NOTE: You do NOT need to print the output in its lowest format. You should print in its original fraction format.
# The names of all the websites will be in small case only.
#
# Every string will start from *www. and end with *.com, so well!**
#
# SAMPLE INPUT
# 2
# www.google.com
# www.hackerearth.com
#
# SAMPLE OUTPUT
# 7/14
# 11/19
#
# Explanation
# Consider the first case:
#
# In Jhool's browser, you'll only have to type: ggl.com (7 characters) while in a normal browser, you'll have to
# type www.google.com, which is 14 characters.

#Question 7
# A string is said to be complete if it contains all the characters from a to z. Given a string, check if it complete or
# not.
#
# Input
# First line of the input contains the number of strings N. It is followed by N lines each contains a single string.
#
# Output
# For each test case print "YES" if the string is complete, else print "NO"
#
# Constraints
# 1 <= N <= 10
# The length of the string is at max 100 and the string contains only the characters a to z
