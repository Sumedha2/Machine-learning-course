1 . Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them.

2. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from user and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers. 
Sample data : 3, 5, 7, 23
Output :
List : ['3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23']
Tuple : ('3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23')

3. Write a Python program to accept a filename from the user and print the extension of that. 
Sample filename : abc.java
Output : java

4. Write a Python program to display the first and last colors from the following list.
color_list = ["Red","Green","White" ,"Black"]

5. Write a Python program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value of n+nn+nnn.
Sample value of n is 5
Expected Result : 615

6. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of three given numbers, if the values are equal then return three times of their sum.

7. Write a Python program to get a new string from a given string where "Is" has been added to the front. If the given string already begins with "Is" then return the string unchanged.

8. Write a Python program to count the number 4 in a given list.

9. Write a Python program to print out a set containing all the colors from color_list_1 which are not present in color_list_2.
