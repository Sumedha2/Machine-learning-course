Expected Output :
Letters 6
Digits 2

4. Write a Python program to find maximum and the minimum value in a set.

5. Write a Python program to create a lambda function that adds 15 to a given number passed in as an argument, also create a lambda function that multiplies argument x with argument y and print the result.

6. Write a Python program to filter a list of integers using Lambda.

7. Write a Python program to count the even, odd numbers in a given array of integers using Lambda.
